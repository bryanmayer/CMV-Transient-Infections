This directory contains saved model results data sets for analysis.

1. contour_plot_data.csv is generated by analyze_stochastic_simulations.Rmd that is used by make_contour_plot.py to make the contour plots.

2. The batch simulation data (an 110mb file, stochastic_sim_I_latent.RData) should also be stored here once downloaded from dataverse.

[The data can be downloaded directly by clicking here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/3008959), can be downloaded and saved in R by running `(load(url("https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/3008959"))` and saving manually, or be downloded and saved automatically by running analyze_stochastic_simulations.Rmd.

Data dictionary for stochastic_sim_I_latent.RData. Values for the constants come from literature.
