# Description of scripts

1. simple_stochastic_simulation.Rmd -> Examine some example simulations using the models (located in `model-scripts/`)

2. analyze_stochastic_simulations.Rmd -> Analysis of model simulations across large range of R0 and initial infected cell settings. Comparison to the observed data.

3. make_contour_plot.py  -> The heatmap contour plot can be created by running this python code (assuming matplotlib, numpy, and scipy are installed): `python make_contour_plot.py`.
