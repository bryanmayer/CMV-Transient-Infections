This repository contains the analysis code and data for "Transient oral human cytomegalovirus infections indicate inefficient viral spread from very few initially infected cells."  [http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2017/03/30/JVI.00380-17.abstract](http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2017/03/30/JVI.00380-17.abstract)    

## Data locations

1. Transient infection data from the Ugandan infant cohort are located in [`data-analysis/data/`](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Transient-Infections/tree/master/data-analysis/data).    
2. Simulation results are located in two locations:    
  a. [`stochastic-model-analysis/model-data/`](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Transient-Infections/tree/master/stochastic-model-analysis/model-data)    
  b. A large simulation data set was published to [dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XFXIFO) and can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/3008959).
